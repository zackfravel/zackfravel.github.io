title: "Altera FPGA Spider Robotics Project"
---

Worked with a team on a multi-month project revolving around an Altera FPGA Spider robot. This class was helpful for getting more experience with VLSI design tools and FPGAs, focusing on concepts like edge detection, debouncing, and UART transmission.

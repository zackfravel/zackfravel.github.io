## 2016-2017
Worked on two independent projects simulating RISC microprocessors. The first project was a behavioral simulation of a 5 stage pipelined MIPS CPU architecture in VHDL (RTL level). The second project was different in that all modules were written in Verilog and utilized a common bus architecture with the datapath controlled by a variety of finite state machines. Following behavioral simulation, the CPU was also fully synthesized (gate level) with the Synopsys Design Compiler using a 90nm process.

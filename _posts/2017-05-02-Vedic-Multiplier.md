title: "Low Power Vedic Multiplier Design"
---
## Spring 2017

Performed research on designing low power CMOS Multiplier circuits using the Urdhva Tiryagbhyam Algorithm found in Vedic Mathematics. I implemented the circuits using structural Verilog and tested their effectiveness in lowering power consumption by synthesizing and comparing power analysis results with standard array multipliers.

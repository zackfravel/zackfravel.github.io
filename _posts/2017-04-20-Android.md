title: "Android Mobile User Interface Development"
---
## Spring 2017

Lead user interface developer in a group project dedicated to the design of a mobile app using Android for a cashier service with integrated SQL database for products and employees. This project was mostly beneficial for getting exposure to very basic Android development as well as the variety of choices you have as a software developer when it comes to design methodologies to implement. This project was very useful to me as well because it was my first exposure to working with Git and shared code repositories.

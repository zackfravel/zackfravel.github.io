title: "Vending Machine"

## Fall 2016

As a part of my Embedded Systems course, I Implemented a finite state machine design of a vending machine in VHDL on an Altera FPGA. This project was useful as an introduction to embedded circuits and heirarchical design methodology. I began by implementing a seven segment display module and then expanded that out to work with four seven segment displays to be controlled by buttons and switches on the FPGA. The full documentation of the design and implementation process is detailed in the PDF.

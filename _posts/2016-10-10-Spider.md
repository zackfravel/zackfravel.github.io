title: "Altera FPGA Spider Robotics Project"
---
## Fall 2016

Worked with a team on a multi-month project revolving around an Altera FPGA Spider robot. This class was helpful for getting more experience with VLSI design tools and FPGAs, focusing on concepts like edge detection, debouncing, and UART transmission. We began the semester by buidling out smaller functional blocks in VHDL, such as the variable LED strobing in the video below. After building up a few basic behaviors in VHDL, we switched focus to developing C applications that took advantage of a library of behaviors used to weave together complex movements and overcome obstacles.

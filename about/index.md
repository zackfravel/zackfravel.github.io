# About
I was raised in Little Rock, Arkansas under a family that was extremely gracious about fostering my interests and creativity. I grew up with a burgeoning interest in computers and music, which has stayed with me to this day. While at the University of Arkansas I did my best to make the most of my time as an undergraduate taking courses that piqued my interest in engineering, ethical thoery, and psychology.    

My strengths include (but are obviously not limited to) a familiarity with hardware description languages such as Verilog and VHDL as well as a wide range of VLSI design and analysis tools. I have the most programming experience creating projects with Python, C/C++, Java, JS, and HTML. That being said, learning new syntax has never been the difficult part of problem solving for me.

Outside of school I spend most of my time diving into books or podcasts about politics, Jungian psychology, or new topics in computing such as cryptocurrency.

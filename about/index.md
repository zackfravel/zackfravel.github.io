# About
I grew up in a medical family in Little Rock, Arkansas with a burgeoning interest in computers and music, which has served me well to this day. I was (and still am) extremely curious, susceptible to being consumed by wiki rabbit holes. While studying at the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville I did my best to make the most of my time as an undergraduate, taking courses that piqued my interest in engineering, ethical thoery, and psychology.    

My strengths include (but are obviously not limited to) a proficiency in hardware description languages such as Verilog and VHDL as well as a wide range of VLSI design and analysis tools. When it comes to software development, I have the most programming experience creating projects with Python, C/C++, Java, and HTML. That being said, learning new syntax has never been a significant hinderence in my efforts to solve problems.   

My most recent passion is learning new ways to create art with modular synthesizers. I have spent the last two years investigating exciting ways to perform local music shows with analog electronic circuitry. For me, playing music is as much a meditative exercize as it is a creative process. I feel there is a significant relationship between productivity and engaging in mental exercizes like this. Throughout this time I've taught myself skills in DIY electronics, as well as formed a network of peers who have offered their mentorship and guidence.

Outside of school, while I'm not playing music, I spend most of my time diving into books or podcasts about politics, Jungian psychology, or new topics in computing (cryptocurrencies, artificial intelligence, etc.).

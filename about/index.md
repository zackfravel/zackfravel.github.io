# About
I was raised in Little Rock, Arkansas under a family that was extremely gracious about fostering my interests and creativity. I grew up with a burgeoning interest in computers and music, which has followed me all the way to where I am today. While at the University of Arkansas I did my best to make the most of my time as an undergraduate taking courses that piqued my interest in engineering, ethical thoery, and psychology.

title: "oxDNA Molecular Dynamics Simulator Frontend"
---
## 2017-2018
Currently working with a team to develop a user friendly web based front end for oxDNA, the widely used molecular self assembly simulation software. Currently, oxDNA requires the user to perform a significant amount of Python scripting and terminal usage to run useful DNA simulations. The website is intended to open up these powerful simulation and visualization tools to researchers who lack a computer science background, as well as make information for current users more accesssible.
